# Preface {.unnumbered}

My name is Cristian Mesquida and I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Human-Technology Interaction group. I am a lecturer in Behavioral Research Methods (BRM) 2 and 3, where I teach multiple linear regression and power analysis. This Quarto book compiles the materials for Multiple Regression in BRM 2 (Lectures 1–3) and BRM 3 (Lectures 1–2).
